# AutoPilot-G503-PS25

A consolidated repository containing multiple autonomous driving, rover simulation, CNN-based recognition, and Vision-Language-Model (VLM) integrated modules developed for PS-25.

The repo includes experiments across Webots, Gemini, Drive-LM, location-based modules, and CNN simulations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab  
- For simulations: Webots, Gemini or equivalent simulators  
- GPU recommended for CNN experiments (optional)

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kmitofficial/AutoPilot-G503-PS25.git
cd AutoPilot-G503-PS25
````

(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

Install dependencies (if available):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not present, install missing imports based on individual notebooks.

## Running Modules

### CNN Simulator (Audacity Simulator)

```bash
cd "Audacity Simulator(CNN)"
jupyter notebook
```

Open the relevant `.ipynb` file and run cell-by-cell.

### Autonomous Vehicle / Webots / Gemini

* Open the simulator (Webots/Gemini).
* Load the world/config from the respective folder.
* Run the Python controller script or follow instructions inside that folder.

### Rover Simulation

```bash
cd rover_sim
jupyter notebook
```

Or run any Python control script inside the folder.
